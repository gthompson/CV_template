% PEAK RATES AND LARGEST MAGNITUDE EVENTS IN EARTHQUAKE SWARMS FROM DIFFERENT TECTONIC SETTINGS Stephen R. McNutt1, Glenn Thompson1, Jochen Braunmiller1, Stephen Holtkamp2 1 School of Geosciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA 2 Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK, USA. We present results of recent studies of earthquake swarms from local data at volcanoes, and teleseismic data from MOR and volcanic regions, with the focus on identifying diagnostics. One clear pattern for local volcanic swarms is that peak rates often occur early, whereas the largest M event occurs late. Using a dataset of 20 swarms from the literature, swarm durations ranged from 12 h to 180 d, measured from swarm onset to eruption onset. Data were normalized to % duration. Peak rates occurred from 1-42 % of the way through swarms (with 2 outliers), whereas the largest M event occurred from 32-99 % of the way through. Additional evidence from 4 cases suggests that the seismic source size grows systematically, especially for events with similar waveforms (families). This is revealed in plots of M or amplitude versus time for event families. For comparison, 19 cases of mid-ocean ridge swarms and 67 cases of teleseismic volcanic swarms were analyzed. The MOR data show durations of 1-42 d, with peak rates occurring 1-24 % of the way through and largest M occurring 1-87 % of the way through. In 6 cases largest M occurs before or at the same time as peak rate. The teleseismic volcanic data show durations of <1 to 577 d, with peak rates occurring 1 to 100 % of the way through and largest M occurring 1-100 % of the way through. Thus the patterns for MOR and teleseismic volcanic swarms are similar to each other but differ significantly from that for local volcanic swarms. Further work on volcanic swarms shows that the distribution of seismicity before the peak rate differs from after, suggesting two dominant processes. The durations of post-peak portions are roughly proportional to the peak rates. This is similar to the behavior of aftershock sequences and suggests that diffusion is a controlling process. The portions of the swarms prior to the peaks behave differently, however. These may represent the invasion of hot fluids and the opening or reopening of cracks prior to magma intrusion. We infer that the growth in event size reflects activation of a preferred magma pathway. Recognition of such patterns, linked to processes, may help to improve monitoring and reduce risks from eruptions. Comparison is recommended between the patterns observed here and those associated with induced seismicity from fracking and deep well injection.

% Catalogs of earthquakes located using differential travel-time techniques are a core product of volcano observatories, and while vital, they represent an incomplete perspective of volcanic seismicity. Many (often most) earthquakes are too small to locate accurately, and are omitted from available catalogs. Low frequency events, tremor and signals related to rockfalls, pyroclastic flows and lahars are not systematically catalogued, and yet from a hazard management perspective are exceedingly important. Because STA/LTA detection schemes break down in the presence of high amplitude tremor, swarms or dome collapses, catalogs may suggest low seismicity when seismicity peaks. We propose to develop a workflow and underlying software toolbox that can be applied to near-real-time and offline waveform data to produce comprehensive catalogs of volcanic seismicity. Existing tools to detect and locate phaseless signals will be adapted to fit within this framework. For this proof of concept the toolbox will be developed in MATLAB, extending the existing GISMO toolbox (an object-oriented MATLAB toolbox for seismic data analysis). Existing database schemas such as the CSS 3.0 will need to be extended to describe this wider range of volcano-seismic signals. WOVOdat may already incorporate many of the additional tables needed. Thus our framework may act as an interface between volcano observatories (or campaign-style research projects) and WOVOdat. We aim to take the further step of reducing volcano-seismic catalogs to sets of continuous metrics that are useful for recognizing data trends, and for feeding alarm systems and forecasting techniques. Previous experience has shown that frequency index, peak frequency, mean frequency, mean event rate, median event rate, and cumulative magnitude (or energy) are potentially useful metrics to generate for all catalogs at a 1-minute sample rate (directly comparable with RSAM and similar metrics derived from continuous data). Our framework includes tools to plot these metrics in a consistent manner. We work with data from unrest at Redoubt volcano and Soufriere Hills volcano to develop our framework

% We have designed a real-time earthquake swarm monitoring system that can provide on the fly metrics to quantify volcano-seismic swarms. These metrics provide a quantitative perspective of the swarm's activity relative to comparable sequences elsewhere. This system also identifies the start and end of an earthquake swarm, and also significant escalations in a swarm. Our system consists of a real-time event catalog, a swarm tracking system and a generic alarm management system. The tracking system continuously measures mean event rate, median event rate, mean magnitude and cumulative magnitude. These are compared with (configurable) swarm start, escalation and end thresholds that define the levels at which alarms are declared. The alarm management system dispatches alarms to a call-down list, allowing observatory scientists to be notified in sequence until someone acknowledges the alarm via a confirmation web page. Swarm tracking has proven to be an effective way to characterize the conduit processes as they unfold. By serving parameters that describe seismic swarms while the processes are still unfolding, systems such as the one described here provide an ability to quantify the seismic behavior within the conduit system and provide tools for on the fly comparisons to similar events elsewhere and/or earlier in the same volcanic sequence.

% We ran two alarm algorithms on real-time data from Redoubt volcano during the 2009 crisis. The first algorithm was designed to detect escalations in continuous seismicity (tremor). This is implemented within an application called IceWeb which computes reduced displacement, and produces plots of reduced displacement and spectrograms linked to the Alaska Volcano Observatory internal webpage every 10 minutes. Reduced displacement is a measure of the amplitude of volcanic tremor, and is computed by applying a geometrical spreading correction to a displacement seismogram. When the reduced displacement at multiple stations exceeds pre-defined thresholds and there has been a factor of 3 increase in reduced displacement over the previous hour, a tremor alarm is declared. The second algorithm was to designed to detect earthquake swarms. The mean and median event rates are computed every 5 minutes based on the last hour of data from a real-time event catalog. By comparing these with thresholds, three swarm alarm conditions can be declared: a new swarm, an escalation in a swarm, and the end of a swarm. The end of swarm alarm is important as it may mark a transition from swarm to continuous tremor. Alarms from both systems were dispatched using a generic alarm management system which implements a call-down list, allowing observatory scientists to be called in sequence until someone acknowledged the alarm via a confirmation web page. The results of this simple approach are encouraging. The tremor alarm algorithm detected 26 of the 27 explosive eruptions that occurred from 23 March - 4 April. The swarm alarm algorithm detected all five of the main volcanic earthquake swarm episodes which occurred during the Redoubt crisis on 26-27 February, 21-23 March, 26 March, 2-4 April and 3-7 May. The end-of-swarm alarms on 23 March and 4 April were particularly helpful as they were caused by transitions from swarm to tremor shortly preceding explosive eruptions; transitions which were detected much earlier by the swarm algorithm than they were by the tremor algorithm.

% Tremor signals associated with Strombolian eruptions of Shishaldin Volcano on April 19 and April 23, 1999, were the strongest recorded anywhere in the Aleutian Islands by the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) in its 10 year history. Throughout the 1998-1999 seismic unrest at Shishaldin, spectrograms (with a frequency resolution of 0.1 Hz) and reduced displacement (Dr) plots were computed in near-real-time (10 mins) and displayed on the World Wide Web. The tools often gave the first warning of changes in activity, and being able to check these data remotely at any time (over the Web) was invaluable. They also provided an excellent database for further analysis. Analyses of Dr and spectra reveal that the eruption sequences on April 19 and April 23 followed similar patterns. Both were preceded by $sim$ 2 days of tremor which gradually intensified. A rapid increase commenced $sim$ 2 hours prior to the maximum observed Dr in both cases (30 cm$^2$ and 37 cm$^2$ respectively). Several further pulses of strong tremor (Dr $_gt_$ 20 cm$^2$) then occured before an abrupt reduction in tremor (Dr $_lt_$ 2 cm$^2$). Strong tremor lasted about 16 hours for April 19 and 6 hours for April 23. However, the main phase of the April 19 eruption was characterised by a very wide-band signal associated with ash ejection to an altitude of $sim$ 50000 feet; no corresponding signal was observed in the April 23 sequence and relatively little ash was observed although a large thermal anomaly was seen in satellite data. This suggests that the main phase on April 19 corresponded to a vent clearing eruption. The dominant tremor frequency immediately after this eruption was lower than that immediately before. A significant increase in the characteristic scale length (for an exponential relation between duration and amplitude) also occured suggesting that the vent clearing eruption modified the source geometry. Strong tremor on April 23 had a higher frequency, which was likely the result of lower gas content. Tremor was a key diagnostic for evaluating the activity of Shishaldin during its 1999 eruptions.
