Real-time, round-the-clock monitoring of the Soufriere Hills Volcano eruption which recommenced in November 1999 and continued until July 2003. Ran the Operations Room by day and 24-hour surveillance of the volcano. Built the seismic monitoring programme, brought in new data acquisition systems, merged the analog and digital seismic networks, developed alarm systems, web-based monitoring tools and a broad suite of data analysis tools. Proposed an infrasound network and a Belham River monitoring network. Seamlessly managed the move to the new observatory in Dec 2002/Jan 2003 without any data loss. Recovered and securely archived and databased all seismic data and initiated numerous projects and collaborations with research scientists. Successfully obtained funding for a new digital network.
